1. We can click another card before the timer of 800ms for error or correct selection expires and the problem is that the handler for the ul and thus all li's is active in the meantime, so we can remove the listener and bind it again after the timer expires or we can think of some other logic...

2. Sometimes due to these absurd selections that a user makes, the UI gets disturbed...
